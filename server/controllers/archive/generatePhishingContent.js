        **Requirements:**
        - The email **must include one or multiple attachment in the end. Represent ths by writing out the document name(S) in the end**.
        - The email **must contain all features from**:  
        **Suspicious features:** ${selectedFeatureNames.join(', ')}  
        **Normal features:** ${nonSelectedFeatureNames.join(', ')}
        - Each sentence in the email body must be **either highly suspicious or completely normal**, depending on the feature it represents.
        - **DO NOT** use structured headers like "Message" or "Contact". The email must flow naturally.
        - **Make the attachment sound highly important**, using a **filename that seems trustworthy yet potentially dangerous** (e.g., \"Security_Update.pdf\" or \"Account_Review.exe\").
        - If the **attachment is/are suspicious**, describe it in a way that makes it seem **critical but slightly alarming**.
        - The **sender should sound legitimate but have subtle red flags**, such as an unusual email format or slight inconsistencies.

        ### Requirements:
        - The message **must not contain any attachments**, but it should **urge the recipient to click a link** or **take an action quickly**.
        - The text message **must contain all features from**:  
        **Suspicious features:** \${selectedFeatureNames.join(', ')}

        - Each sentence in the message must be **either highly suspicious or completely normal**, depending on the feature it represents.

        - If the **message includes a link**, it should **sound critical yet slightly alarming**. The link **must look slightly off**, like a convincing typo (e.g., \`my-bank-security.com\` instead of \`mybank.com\`).
        - The **sender should sound legitimate** but contain subtle red flags, such as an **unusual phone number, slight grammatical errors, or an overly generic tone**.
